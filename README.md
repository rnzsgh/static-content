# Overview

This repo contains an AWS [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template that creates an [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distribution with an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket that serves as the origin for the distribution, and an [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) for CI/CD, based on commits to a separate [GitHub](https://github.com) repo.
